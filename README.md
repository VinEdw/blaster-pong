# blaster-pong

Imagine Pong, but you get a blaster.
W and S control the left paddle. D is used to fire.
UpArrow and DownArrow control the right paddle. LeftArrow is used to fire.
As of now, you have to control both paddles or get a friend; no CPU.
Press Space to start the round and reset it after it ends. You can also press Space to pause and unpause the game mid round.
The blaster has a five second cooldown. If you hit your opponent twice, you get a point for that round. If you get the ball past your opponent, you get a point for that round, regardless of lives.
The first player to reach 5 points wins the match.
Have fun! :)
